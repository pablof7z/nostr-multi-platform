//! Relay-author score lookup seam (W4).
//!
//! A substrate-level read-only trait that lets `apply_selection` ask "is
//! this relay warm for this author?" without depending on nmp-core. The
//! production impl lives in `nmp-core/kernel/relay_score_lookup_impl.rs`
//! (`impl RelayAuthorScoreLookup for Kernel`). Tests and wasm paths use
//! [`NoopRelayAuthorScoreLookup`], which always returns 0.0 / false.
//!
//! # Doctrine guards
//!
//! - **D0** — no protocol nouns; keys are `(author: &str, relay: &str)`.
//! - **D3** — used as a *filter* only (drops cold relay/author pairs before
//!   the greedy pass); it never adds a new routing lane.
//! - **D6** — trait methods are total, return owned `f32` / `bool`; no
//!   `Result`, no panic.
//! - **D8** — `is_warm` delegates to `weight` which is an O(log N) BTreeMap
//!   lookup; the production implementation canonicalizes the relay URL
//!   (one allocation per call for non-canonical inputs).
//!
//! # `WARM_THRESHOLD`
//!
//! 0.40 — admits a single-hit cell (weight = 1/(1+0+1) ≈ 0.50) but
//! excludes a hit paired with a miss (1/(1+1+1) ≈ 0.33). See §8.5 Gigi
//! math in `docs/design/relay-search-radius-impl-plan.md`.
//! The kernel-side mirror lives in `kernel/relay_score.rs::WARM_THRESHOLD`;
//! they must stay in sync — a test in `relay_score_lookup_impl_tests.rs`
//! asserts equality to catch drift.

/// Score floor at-or-above which a `(author, relay)` cell is considered
/// "warm" for Phase-1 selection bias. See module doc for the Gigi math.
