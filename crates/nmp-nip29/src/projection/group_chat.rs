//! `GroupChatProjection` — the read-side of a NIP-29 group-chat screen.
//!
//! This is **pure consumption**: a [`KernelEventObserver`] that accumulates the
//! h-tagged user-content events of a single group and serialises them as a
//! flat, newest-first message list for a native shell to render. It registers
//! no actions, mints no FFI symbols, and never touches the actor loop.
//!
//! ## How it plugs into the snapshot seam
//!
//! NMP has two complementary extension seams (see
//! `nmp_core::kernel::snapshot_registry` and
//! `nmp_core::actor::commands::event_observer`):
//!
//! - **`KernelEventObserver`** — the *ingest* side. `on_kernel_event` fires
//!   once per accepted event on the actor thread; a projection accumulates the
//!   facts it cares about into its own interior-mutable state.
//! - **`register_snapshot_projection`** — the *output* side. A host registers
//!   a no-argument closure that runs on every snapshot tick and returns a
//!   `serde_json::Value` appended under a host-chosen key.
//!
//! `GroupChatProjection` is built to sit on *both*: it implements
//! `KernelEventObserver` for ingest, and exposes [`GroupChatProjection::snapshot_json`]
//! — a cheap, non-blocking, no-argument read — so the host can register it as
//!
//! ```ignore
//! let projection = Arc::new(GroupChatProjection::new(group_id));
//! let observer_id = app.register_event_observer(Arc::clone(&projection) as Arc<dyn KernelEventObserver>);
//! let snap = Arc::clone(&projection);
//! app.register_snapshot_projection("nmp.nip29.group_chat", move || snap.snapshot_json());
//! ```
//!
//! Wiring that closure is the host app composition crate's job (a separate
//! PR); this crate only provides the projection type and a snapshot read
//! that is safe to call from inside a tick.
//!
//! ## D8 — non-blocking
//!
//! [`GroupChatProjection::snapshot_json`] runs on the actor thread inside the
//! snapshot tick. It takes one uncontended `Mutex` lock and clones a small
//! `Vec` — no I/O, no relay round-trips, no event-store scan. The accumulation
//! work (`on_kernel_event`) is likewise a single lock + map insert.
//!
//! ## What this projection can and cannot filter
//!
//! NIP-29 group identity is the **pair** `(host_relay_url, local_id)`
//! (`group_id.rs`). A [`KernelEvent`] carries only `id, author, kind,
//! created_at, tags, content` — it has **no relay-provenance metadata**. So the
//! projection can only filter on what is *in the event*: the kind and the
//! `["h", local_id]` tag. Restricting ingest to the group's host relay is an
//! upstream routing concern — the `relay_pin` lane on `LogicalInterest` /
//! `ViewDependencies` — not something this observer can or should re-check.
//! A correctly-pinned subscription only ever delivers events from the host
//! relay; this projection trusts that pin and matches on `local_id` alone.
