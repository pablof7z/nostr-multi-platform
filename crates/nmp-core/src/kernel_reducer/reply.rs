//! Reply write-path surface for [`super::KernelReducer`].
//!
//! Split from `kernel_reducer.rs` to keep that file under the 500-LOC hard
//! ceiling (AGENTS.md). These two methods form the PR-5 reply write path:
//! `publish_signed_event` feeds a caller-signed event through the publish
//! engine and fans out the resulting outbound frames; `build_reply_tags`
//! resolves NIP-10 marked-form reply tags from the kernel store before the
//! async sign boundary so no `RefCell` borrow lives across an await point.

    /// path. The returned `Vec<OutboundMessage>` is the engine's per-(outbox-
    /// relay) `EVENT` frame set, already AUTH-pause-partitioned through
    /// `partition_auth_paused` for symmetry with the `handle_relay_*` surface
    /// above.

    /// callers that have no extra `#p` tags pass an empty slice. The engine
    /// recomputes `#p` tags from `signed.unsigned.tags` itself, so this slice
    /// is informational only (kept on the surface so a future caller that
    /// needs additional outbox routing tags has a place to inject them).

    /// `correlation_id` is the host-visible action id the publish should
    /// report in the `action_results` projection on terminal verdicts (per-
    /// relay OK / failed). Pass `Some(id)` when the publish is a dispatched
    /// action whose host caller is awaiting a terminal under `id` (the wasm
    /// runtime's `dispatch_app_action_async` Promise path); pass `None` for
    /// non-dispatch callers (the engine then reports the event id as the
    /// terminal key, matching every existing non-dispatched native publish).
