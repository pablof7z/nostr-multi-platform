# NMP Performance Test Battery

Prove NMP's performance *claims* to adopters. Chirp iOS is the harness; every metric here must generalize to **any app built on NMP**, not just Chirp.

## Critical reframing (read first)

The NMP performance battery must be designed by an Opus agent, implemented by Haiku agents, and reviewed by Sonnet agents, with all work done in git worktrees and proven fixes PR'd and merged to master.

Chirp iOS serves as the testing ground for optimizing NMP framework performance, not as the optimization target itself. Every metric here must generalize to **any app built on NMP**, not just Chirp.

The 98% idle false-wake in `docs/perf/reactivity-bench/2026-05-17-run-001.md` measured a **proposed** per-view reactivity engine that lives only in `crates/nmp-testing/bin/reactivity-bench`. It is **not the live path.**

The live actor (`crates/nmp-core/src/actor/tick.rs`) gates on a whole-kernel `changed_since_emit` flag and emits a full FlatBuffers snapshot at ≤4Hz. The test `idle_ticks_do_not_emit_snapshots_when_state_unchanged` proves exactly **1 frame/sec at true idle** — the ~4/sec SwiftUI re-renders in Chirp are not spurious Rust emits.

Under a live-but-quiet feed, `poll_claim_expansion` and claim churn legitimately bump `changed_since_emit`. The actor sends a full snapshot. iOS re-evaluates every row body because `TimelineItem` is not Equatable-diffed by identity. The fix is iOS-side identity diffing (C3), not a Rust reactive engine change.

The "D8 composite reverse index" the bench described **is shipped** — in the **planner** (`nmp-planner/src/interest.rs`), deduplicating N interests → M≤N wire REQs. That is coalescing at the REQ level. The unshipped piece is the per-view dispatch engine (D1), which is gated before it lands.

## Battery — 14 metrics, ordered by priority

| # | ID | Layer | Target | Current state |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **C3-idle-rerender-ios** | ios | 0 body re-evals for unchanged rows | ~4/sec |
| 2 | **S2-snapshot-scaling-vs-state** | rust | per-event µs at 100k ≤ 1.5× at 1k | **Fixed by PR #873** |
| 3 | **M3-working-set-bounded** | rust | ≤100 MB @ 100 views/10k hot events; 0 monotonic growth/1h | unmeasured |
| 4 | **D1-false-wake-engine-gate** | rust | false_wakeup_rate ≤ 0.10 at idle and scroll | engine not shipped; bench-only |
| 5 | **B1-typed-decode-success** | ffi | ≥99.9% typed-decode over 1000-tick window | unmeasured |
| 6 | **C1-snapshot-apply-p99** | ios | p99 ≤ 16ms; ceiling ≤ 50ms | ceiling gated; p99 unmeasured |
| 7 | **R4-coalescing-ratio** | rust | M/N ≤ 0.3 for typical interest set | planner coalesces; ratio unmeasured |
| 8 | **Q5-actor-queue-drain** | rust | drains to 0 within 500ms after 10k-cmd burst | unmeasured |
| 9 | **X6-cold-start-latency** | ios | first event ≤ 1500ms median vs local relay | unmeasured |
| 10 | **I7-timeline-ingest-throughput** | rust | ≤ 50µs/event; 0 allocs at steady state | 45.95µs/event |
| 11 | **A1-warm-reclaim-name-gap** | rust | 0 ticks showing shortHex for cached author | ~1–2 ticks/back-nav |
| 12 | **A2-name-regression-count** | ios | 0 name regressions (hard gate) | non-zero on every back-nav |
| 13 | **P8-scroll-fps** | ios | ≥58fps; hitch < 5ms/s with concurrent 4Hz snapshots | no baseline set |
| 14 | **N9-nav-transition-frames** | ios | 0 dropped frames on push/pop | no baseline set |

The 14-metric NMP performance battery is documented in `docs/wiki/nmp-perf-battery.md`.

**S2 snapshot scaling**: `estimated_store_bytes` must be O(1), memoized via `Cell<Option<usize>>` invalidated at all store-mutation sites, with at most 1.6× cost increase at 100k events (target ≤4×).

<!-- citations: [^c9ae5-25] -->
## Priority rationale

**C3** is #1: every NMP app on iOS suffers this. Any state mutation anywhere causes every visible row to re-evaluate its SwiftUI body. Row-level equatable identity diffing is the canonical fix for snapshot-driven UIs and has zero Rust-side risk.

**S2** is #2: `estimated_store_bytes` ran two full O(store) field-length scans on **every** snapshot emit — O(events) work every 250ms. At 100k stored events this silently broke NMP's promise of bounded platform cost. Fixed by PR #873 (memoized Cell, invalidated at all 5 mutation sites).

**D1** is #4 (not #1): the live actor doesn't use the per-view reactive engine. Until that engine ships, conjunctive-dispatch false-wake rate is irrelevant to production. When it ships, D1 gates its merge.

## Tests that currently cover these metrics

| Metric | Test | Location |
|---|---|---|
| S2 | `snapshot_make_update_cost_is_sublinear_in_store_size` | `crates/nmp-core` (added by PR #873) |
| S2 | `estimated_store_bytes_cache_matches_fresh_compute` | same |
| I7 | `timeline_ingest_perf` | `crates/nmp-core/src/kernel/timeline_perf_tests.rs` |
| A1 | `warm_reclaim_reemits_profile_next_tick_with_no_req` | PR #821 |
| A1/A2 | `testProfileName_persistsThroughNavRoundtrip` | `ios/Chirp/ChirpUITests/ChirpUITests.swift` |
| P8 | `testScrollPerformance` | same (no baseline set yet) |
| N9 | `testNavTransitionPerformance` | same (no baseline set yet) |

## Next optimizations in priority order

1. **C3 — iOS row Equatable diffing** (priority 1, medium effort): Make all snapshot row types (`TimelineItem`, `EventCard`, etc.) conform to `Equatable`/`Identifiable` by stable `id`. In the snapshot apply path, diff incoming rows against current before mutating SwiftUI state. Only rows whose data changed should trigger body re-evaluation. Expected: C3 collapses from ~4/sec → 0 for quiet feeds.

2. **M3 — GC proof harness** (priority 3, medium effort): Rust test that opens 100 views, ingests 10k events, drops all claims, calls prune, and asserts RSS returns to within 1.1× cold baseline. GC exists conceptually but is unproven.

3. **B1 — FlatBuffers decode telemetry** (priority 5, low effort): Counter in the Swift decode path incremented on typed-decode failure. Expose via diagnostics projection. One decode failure should log a warning.

## How to run the Rust portion

```sh
# S2 scaling test (fast, ~2s)
cargo test -p nmp-core --lib perf -- --show-output

# I7 ingest throughput (requires --release)
cargo test -p nmp-core timeline_ingest_perf --release -- --ignored --nocapture
```
