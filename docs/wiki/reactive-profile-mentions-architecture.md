# Reactive Profile Mentions — LiveProfileMap Architecture

> Inline nostr:npub1 mention chips resolve profiles reactively via LiveProfileMap, which ingests three kernel projections and falls back to truncated npub until kind:0 arrives.

## Overview

Inline `nostr:npub1…` / `nostr:nprofile1…` URIs in note content render as interactive mention chips. The chip shows an honest placeholder (`@npub1abc…` truncated npub) immediately on cold start, then upgrades in place to `@DisplayName` once a kind:0 profile event arrives. This reactive promise is fully implemented in master via `LiveProfileMap` in the gallery TUI. [^752b5-1]


On iOS, `MentionProfile` carries a `display` field for exactly this lookup. However, two author display locations ignore it: `NoteRowView.authorDisplayLabel` hardcodes `item.authorPubkey.shortHex` and `ModularBlockView.moduleRow` hardcodes `pubkey.shortHex`, instead of preferring `mentionProfiles[pubkey]?.display`. [^9a2c7-31]
## LiveProfileMap — Three-Projection Design

The canonical implementation lives in `apps/nmp-gallery/src/data.rs` (lines 138–173). `LiveProfileMap` ingests **all three** kernel projections:

- **`claimed_profiles`** — component-owned claims; this is the claim-driven path for inline-content mention resolution
- **`mention_profiles`** — timeline-row author profiles (top-level authors only, not inline mention pubkeys)
- **`author_view.profile`** — full profile card

The `resolve()` method (line 180) returns the kind:0 display name if available, and falls back to the truncated npub (line 184) when no kind:0 has arrived. The fallback is explicit and intentional — it is an honest representation of the unknown state, not an error. [^752b5-2]

## Shell-Boundary Wiring

The profile host is wired once at the shell boundary via `profile_host_from_context` → `NostrMentionProfileHost` trait (present in `nostr_mention_chip.rs`). The `NostrMentionProfileHost` trait is the abstraction layer that mention chips use to query display names; the `LiveProfileMap` is its implementation in the gallery shell. Shells must not duplicate profile resolution logic — they implement the trait once and pass it through. [^752b5-3]

## Why mention_profiles Does Not Cover Inline Mentions

`mention_profiles_from_items` maps only `item.author_pubkey` — top-level timeline authors, not pubkeys mentioned inside note bodies. Inline-content mention resolution uses the separate `claimed_profiles` projection, which is keyed by all currently claimed pubkeys (claim-driven). Any architecture that routes inline mention resolution through `mention_profiles` alone will miss content-embedded pubkeys. [^752b5-4]

## Superseded Design

An earlier branch (`fix/reactive-profile-mentions`, base commit 344d7aa7) implemented this promise via `claimed_profiles` mirrored through `embed_host.rs`. That approach is fully superseded by `LiveProfileMap`. The branch was deleted once the overlap was confirmed. Any future branch attempting to re-introduce an `embed_host`-based profile resolution path must first verify that `LiveProfileMap` does not already cover it. [^752b5-5]
